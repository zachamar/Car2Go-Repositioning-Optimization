    "$\\quad$ It is early July 2016 and the CEO of Car2go, Paul DeLong, is sitting at his desk reflecting on another year for the EV sharing program that will fit into the smart city goals to make urban habitats more efficient and more sustainable. Mr DeLong wishes to continue the Car2go program in San Diego and needs to plan his strategy for next year. He needs to change things around as Car2Go is currently failing to successfully satisfy customer demands while maintaining low operating costs and they are close to bankruptcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Paul decided to hire a team of data scientists, who were experts in optimization and Python, to help him solve the strategic and operational challenges that Car2go faces. In particular, he is trying to understand what the ideal placement and repositioning of EV's is in order to maximize the company's profits. This is quite a complicated task as he needs to understand his demand, make sure enough customers are satisfied and that the cars are always charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ As the board of director's new Chief of Scientists, we will clearly lay out the steps taken to observe the past data given for San Diego, and use this information on demand and trip history to develop a model that will best fit the needs to satisfy demand and supply at the lowest cost."

    "### Step 1: Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The first step was obviously to import the data. Once that was done we observed what we had. We quickly realised that the data was not clean so step one of our data analysis is data cleanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ **Step 1: Removing Unnecessary Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The dataset had various columns that were of no use to us such as (but not limited to):\n",
    "- the \"origin\" or \"destination\" columns since they were already broken down into longitude and latitude\n",
    "- the \"Total_TravelTime\" column which did not make much sense\n",
    "- the \"time_gap\" as it was duplicated etc ...\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We therefore removed the columns we did not find any use for and were left with a simplified dataset containing information about the trips we had, their origin, destination and how much time they took. We also converted the hours to San Diego Hours. The columns origin and dest hours were actually the hours in the HeadQuarters, in Germany. The correct hour times were the SD_hr's which we then renamed origin and destination hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ **Step 2: Removing \"Nan\" Values From the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The next thing we did was check the integrity of the data. We quickly noticed that some of the columns contained \"Nan\" values, which are hard to deal with. When looking at the number of \"Nan's\", we realized there were not so many and we decided to simply remove the rows that were incomplete. Removing these rows will allow us to manipulate the data in an easier way.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ **Step 3: Removing Outlier Trips**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Like in most data processing, the next step was the remove outliers. When looking at the columns we have, \"travel.times\" is our main quantitative column and thus we will try and remove any trips that seem to make no sense. By creating a `summary` function we were able to observe the max, min, mean and standard deviation of the column and the results were as followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The maximum is: 1435 min (too long)\n",
    "- The minimum is: 5 min\n",
    "- The mean is: 75 min\n",
    "- The standard deviation is: 185 min (high variability)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ From this we can clearly see that there are outliers. A trip that lasts 1435 min (24h) does not make much sense for a single ride. After researching online, we realized that Car2go has the option to rent the car for a one or two days period in what they call packages. However, since these long duration trips are not important for us in terms of repositioning the hourly cars, we will exclude them. We also had to do something about the extremely high standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We therefore had to find a cut-off for the trips duration. From google maps, we saw that driving all across San Diego takes between 20 and 30 min. We also found out that San Diego suffers from heavy traffic. We therefore decided it would make sense to triple that time and set it as an upper limit. This is reasonable as the upper limit would be 90min and we saw the mean was 75. From the graphs (see further below), we can also see there are not many trips left after 60min anyways. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We also decided there should be a lower limit (and exclude trips that have time 0) but the minimum was 5 min. We found it reasonable that someone took the car for a quick 5 min grocery run and decided we would not remove any trips on the lower end.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ **Step 4: Removing Incomplete Days**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Finally, since we are going to deal with daily data, we had to make sure we only had complete days to avoid biasing certain hours. The initial data set went from *2014-03-06 20:46* to *2014-04-01 9:55*. This means we have the end of the day on the 6th of March and the beginning of the day on the 1st of April. To avoid problems in the future we only kept data between the 7th and the 31st of March, giving us 24 days of data.\n",

    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We can clearly see that there are not many trips more than one hour long, most of them last between 10 and 20 min, but a fair amount do last 30 to 40 min as well. We can also confirm that 90 was a good cutoff as there are not many trips left after. Finally, here are the new trip statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The maximum is: 85.0 - makes sense\n",
    "- The minimum is: 5.0 - makes sense\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ **Popular Hours Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Now that we know how long trips last, let' take a look at what times they tend to occur at:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"popular hours.png\" style = \"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<center> Figure 2: Demand By Hour By Origin </center>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ From the plot above we clearly see what the popular hours are. First, as expected, the hours where people go and come back from work (7-8-9 and 17-18) are hours of high demand. After all, this is a form of \"public\" transport. It is however interesting to note that the most popular times of the day are 14,15,16h. This might mean that it is used a lot by high schoolers (in the USA most of them can drive) who go home for lunch or that leave school for extracurricular activities. It can also represent people going to meetings around the city during the day. We can also see that people do not use them that much at night, even if the metro does close at 22h, the demand does not go up.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ **Popular Stations Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Our lowest level of granularity for this case will be at the zipcode level. Therefore, let's take a look at the popular and unpopular zips codes. The first analysis performed contrasted the origins and the destinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr>\n",
    "<td> <img src = \"Origin Zips.png\" style = \"width: 400px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "<td> <img src = \"Destination Zips.png\" style = \"width: 400px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "</tr><table>\n",

    "<pre>\n",
    "<center>    Figure 3: Popular Origin Zip Codes                Figure 4 (Right): Popular Destination Zip Codes </center>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The results from the above image are very curious: A station that is a popular origin is also a popular destination. A station that is a non-popular origin is also a non-popular destination. That would mean that a lot of the trips are probably round trips. This is excellent for us as we will have very little repositioning to do every hour and our costs will be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ In order to check our hypothesis we pivoted the origins and destinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Origin and Destination Top 10.png\" width = 800px;/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<center> Figure 5: Origin and Destination Combinations </center>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We can clearly see the most popular combinations are round trips. The diagonal of the table is usually big numbers. (We further analysed non round trips and nothing special came out of it. The same stations were popular/unpopular, just proportionately smaller as there are less non round trips.)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Now that we have all this information, let's map the stations we have and color them in terms of popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Green: high popularity\n",
    "- Blue average popularity\n",
    "- Red: low popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr>\n",
    "<td> <img src = \"StationMap.png\" style = \"width: 550px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "<td> <img src = \"HeatMap.png\" style = \"width: 630px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "</tr><table>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<center> Figure 6: Stations Mapping </center>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ From the map on the left, we can observe that there are two main zones: uptown and downtown. Downtown consists of the two red stations on the bottom of the map, showing us that people from the south of the city do not really use the product. Uptown on the other hand is where all the popular stations are. We have two greens on the upper left (near the ocean), and then a nice cluster of green and blue in the middle of city. We can only assume that is where most people go to work. There are also a couple blue stations on the left near the city airport, which makes sense as it is a great way to go to the airport without paying a cab or having to worry about parking there, and in the upper right, where San Diego University is.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ From the map on the right, we can observe that the demand is most dense in the areas of green stations, which makes sense. However, we do see a couple of red stations in the middle of high demand zones: the first one is centre bottom, above coronado and the second one is middle left (near 2B-3-4A). This is surprising as the color of the station is based on its demand. This might mean that in the middle of these high demand zone, some zips are not popular. In fact, when we searched for a reason we realized these areas are full of parcs as well as near the harbour. This would explain why there are not many Car2Go users there. In the first case people would walk around instead of drive and in the second case, trucks would be more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ To finish our stations analysis, let's look at what combination of stations have the longest trips:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Times Taken Between Stations.png\" style = \"width: 250px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<center> Figure 7: Top 10 Station Combinations in Terms of Average Drive Time </center>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The results from this are very interesting. The least popular stations, 92123 for example, actually have the longest trips. We can also see that the popular stations are nowhere to be seen, therefore usually trips are short for them. This piece of information combined with the fact that we know most trips are round trips means that very little repositioning will have to be done during the day as cars reposition themselves automatically."

Along with zipcodes: 92102, 92107, 92116, a high number of electric vehicles (double digits) are to be made available in these popular stations to satisfy their respective demand.

Instead, cars should be repositioned to areas that will be relatively less popular but still require a high number of available EVs to satisfy customer demand. \n",

Once again station 92101 is the most popular, followed by 92103 and 92109.

    "$\\quad$ Now that we have a fully functioning model, we will start with our sensitivity analysis. The first one we will look at is what happens if our cars get damaged. The reason we chose this topic is because there have been many flash floods in San Diego. It is therefore important for management to take into account the number of cars they will lose. EV’s may be significantly damaged or rendered completely unusable after flooding occurs. We will therefore look at what happens if we change the number of cars available. To do so we will assume 10% of the vehicles of the city will be damaged and therefore not usable. We will also attempt to find the lowest number of cars needed in order to satisfy the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ After coding the sensitivity analysis, we realised that we have too many EVs. In fact, even after a flood, with 90% of the vehicles remaining we can still satisfy the constraints we set to our model and make the same amount of profits. What is even more surprising is that we can satisfy the constraints of our model and make the same amount of profits even with 15% of the vehicles. We have to lose 86% of our cars before our daily profits start going down (from 6960.82$\\$$ to 6955.26$\\$$), and even then we only lost about 5$\\$$. Finally, we are only unable to satisfy 80% of the demand once we cut down our vehicle fleet to 4% of what we currently have.\n",

    "$\\quad$ This information is crucial to the managers at Car2Go. While they currently have 400 cars, only 14% of them are needed to satisfy the demand and make as much profits as right now and only 5% of them are needed to satisfy 80% of the demand. They are therefore pretty safe when it comes to flooding and loss of vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We do however recommend they look into removing part of the cars from the streets to avoid potential damage to cars that are probably not being used, and use the excess inventory to replace damaged ones, cars that get in accidents stolen cars etc. Furthermore, if Car2Go is ever in a low cash situation, they could sell EVs. These cars start selling at 25K and selling them could get some cash back into the company.\n"

He obviously knows they will go down, but he wants to understand by how much. He is getting huge pressure from the union to increase the salaries of people who reposition cars as it is too close to minimum wage for such a tiring job.

This represents less than a 1% decrease in overall profits for car2go, while making both the union and the workers happy. This might lead even lead to more profits through lower costs. We did not measure that change, but an increase in wages might lead to an increase in productivity or even in more care by the workers when dealing with the Car2Go cars. This might lead to them being more careful and not damaging the vehicles as much."

    "## Analysis 3: Removal of Unpopular Zips\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We decided to conduct our third sensitivity analysis on the elimination of unpopular zip codes. Considering the costs of making our service available in a zip code such as maintenance and repositioning, we wondered whether removing the stations in zip codes that have the least trips or demand would improve our profitability since our main costs come from the repositioning of vehicles. Usually these come from unpopular zips to popular zips. If we restrict Car2go to only popular zip codes then maybe we will be able to increase profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ After coding the sensitivity analysis, we realised that removing zip codes is not a good idea. By removing the 5 least popular zip codes, we lowered our profits from the initial 6960.82$\\$$ to 6950.65$\\$$. In retrospect that makes sense. A repositionment will cost on average less than what we make in a trip. Therefore, if we reposition a vehicle to a location (to make sure a customer can make a trip) we will gain more than we lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Following this logic, we believe Car2Go should try and expand throughout the city. As we do not have information about what demand would be like in new zips, we will not be able to code this. But, we strongly believe that if Car2Go allowed people to go a little further in the suburbs when they dropped off a car, they would be more successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ However, this only works for 2 reasons: first we use zip as the lowest level of granularity. In reality if we used stations, there would be a lot more repositioning and probably more costs. Second and most importantly, we do not consider car damage, accidents, and theft in this project. If there were bad zip codes, not only because of low demand but also because they are in more risky areas and the model took that into account, removing some of those zips which cost more than they bring in terms of car damage could be a good idea. This will be left to the management team to decide.\n"

    "$\\quad$ The last part of this report will deal with a model extension. Until now, we have built 2 models, one simple and one a little more complicated one. However, there are still a lot simplifications and assumptions in these models and now we will try and make it even more realistic. We will look at potential costs and situations that we had not taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limit number of cars charging at a station at the same time**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The first and obvious simplification is that in our second model we assume that the three charging stations have unlimited capacity to charge as many cars as possible. However, we know that is physically impossible, therefore we decided to put a limit to the number of cars that can be charging at a specific station at the same time. We will assume that 10 cars per station at any given time will be the limit. When looking online we saw that is usually how many chargers are in a station. This should not be too much of a problem as we saw in the results of Model 1 (Figure 15) there are rarely more than 10 vehicles in a station at a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Car replacement over time due to use**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Next we will deal with another issue we have not faced yet. In this kind of services, cars need to be replaced on a regular basis in order to provide the best service possible to the customers. Every certain number of trips, an old car is taken out of service and sold at a discounted price. Then a new one is bought to replace it. Usually cars go for 50% of the initial price. Our experts have assumed that every 10K trips a car needs to be replaced. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Most trips last about 20 min. If a car is going at 30km per hour then in 20 min it goes through 10km. We will assume a car can go through 100K km before needing replacement, so an average a car needs to be replaced every 10K trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ This means that every 10K trips we need to buy a new vehicle which costs 25K and we sell them for 12.5K (half price).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Car replacement over time due to accidents**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Finally, we will keep looking at car replacements but will consider that fact that some cars will suffer accidents. From the city statistics we have found out that 1 in every 10K cars will get into an accident. Therefore, every 10K trips we have we need to add the price of car minus 5K of salvage value that the pieces are worth.\n"

    "$\\quad$ When implementing the new constraints and costs in the model we see that the results change drastically. We went from being able to get 6960.82$\\$$ to 4612.28$\\$$. That represents a 33% decrease in daily profits. This goes to show how important it is to look at all the costs of a business. We do however beleive these numbers are much more accurate. This would lead to a yearly profit of 1.7M which is still not bad for a company going bankrupt.\n"

    "$\\quad$ Paul DeLong, Car2Go CEO gave us a mission. He tasked us with saving Car2Go from bankruptcy. He asked us to build a model that will maximize profits by optimizing the repositioning or EVs. In order for us to do so he gave us a data set of about 26K trips that occurred in San Diego. The first thing we did was clean up the data set. We removed useless or duplicated columns, cleaned up the time columns to the correct hour, removed trips that lasted too long and finally removed incomplete days of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ With this clean dataset, we started looking at what insights we could get from the dataset. The first thing we looked at was trip duration. We saw that most trips last either between 10 and 20 minutes or between 30 and 40min. The average was 28 min with a standard deviation of 15 min. This was nice as the variation went from 185min (in the unclean data) to 15min. This shows us that Car2Go is used for small short trips within the city, and even traffic does not make the trips too long. Car2Go seems to be a popular method to commute to work in the morning and afternoon. However, it most used during the afternoon (13-14-15h), which lead us to believe it is an easy way to grab a lunch or go to a meeting during the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ After looking at the trip durations and time they were taken at we investigated the most popular stations. We saw that the city centre (92101) was the most popular one and the outskirts (92123) were the least popular one in terms of origins and destinations. However, the less popular a station have longer trips than popular stations. Finally, we uncovered that Car2Go users usually leave the car in the same zip code that they take it from (high number of round trips). \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The final step of our data exploration was looking at the average revenue and the average cost for Car2Go per trip. We used a variable price (35c per min when it was low demand and 45c per min when it was high demand) and a fixed cost (18c per min cost or 10,8 per hour). We obtained an average revenue of 11.67$\\$$ per trip and an average cost of 5$\\$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Based on all this information and all the assumptions stated above (Section 3) we build our models. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step was to define our parameters. We built:\n",
    "    - 1 **Demand dictionary** (based on 2 zip codes and a time) \n",
    "    - 1 **Price dictionary** (based on 2 zip codes and a time) \n",
    "    - 2 **Costs dictionaries** (based on two zip codes for the first one and one zip code one charging station for the second one). \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ In order to build the dictionaries we used a for loop with a `try` function which caught `KeyError` exceptions and set the values for which we had not information to the average values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second step was to define the variables: X,W,R,C,M,N and their subscript\n",
    "- The third step was to build the first model (no charging)\n",
    "- The final step was to build the second model\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ The first model lead to yearly profits of 2.8M but did not include the charging stations while the second model lead to profits of 2.5M including both the cost to move vehicles to a charger and the cost of electricity, which we have estimated to be 2.64$\\$$ per vehicle. From these models we saw that most of our cars need to be in zip code 92101 (city centre and the most popular by far) but also near the ocean, the airport and San Diego University. However, this model was too simple. There were a lot of assumptions we had done that we thought we could actually take into account. The obvious one being unlimited space at every charging station. We also had not considered the cost of replacing our vehicles over time due to overuse or even accidents. This is why we build a third model, in the Model Extension section, which took all these into account and modified the objective function and the constraints. With this third more accurate model we go to yearly profits of 1.7M, which is significantly less than the initial 2.5M but is a lot more realistic. Furthermore, it is not a bad result for a company nearing bankruptcy. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ San Diego is a city that suffers a lot from floods. We therefore looked into how sensitive we were to loosing vehicles. Statistically, about 10% of the vehicles get some damage from the floods, therefore we looked at what would happen is we only had 90% of our vehicles. It turns out Car2Go has way too many cars and can fully satisfy the current number of trips and make the same profit with 14% of the vehicles and they only need 5% to satisfy the 80% of the demand. This is why we recommend that they remove 80% (in order to have a cushion) of the vehicles from the streets in order to minimize losses in case of a flood or any other natural disaster. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ We also recommend that they increase the salary of the workforce to 12$\\$$ per hour. This would lead to a loss in revenue of not even 1% but might boost the team's morale greatly. This will lead to more motivated employees who work faster and more efficiently and will be more careful with the cars they handle. Furthermore, it might get the unions to be less of a bother in an industry where they consider the treatment of employees despicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Car2Go should also try and expand to more areas. They have a profitable business in San Diego and way too many vehicles. If they placed some in the suburbs or areas where there are currently not cars maybe they could attract some new customer and expand their reach. As they usually make more on a trip than the cost of repositioning and charging, it will be an easy way to increase profits even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Car2Go has paid us to do a job and it is now done. Even if we cost them 3M, they will be able to make that back in less than 2 years instead of shutting down. We do however believe that if they want to go through with this project, they need to give us a more comprehensive dataset. We currently only have 24 days of data. If we would get a full year of data, we could have a more thorough analysis on the demand. Everyday is not really the same, and we are sure there is some seasonality in the demand throughout the months. By making a more accurate demand table we are sure we can build a dictionary that had $D_{ijtdm}$ where d and m are the day and the month. We can also build a forecasting model using predictive analytics and try and estimate next year's demand to know if we need more vehicles and plan ahead. \n",

Observing the above table, we can see that the destination where the most amount of cars (5) are to be repositioned to is at zipcode: 92104, followed by 92103 and 92102 (2). This suggests that the repositioning of cars should be less focused on the most popular zipcode location as cars will be initially placed in this location. Instead, cars should be repositioned to areas that will be relatively less popular but still require a high number of available EVs to satisfy customer demand. \n"

However, charging station 92101 distributes the largest amount of EVs due to its close proximity with locations of high demand. As expected, EVs are sent to the same zipcode as the charging station (92101) due to its high popularity and low associated cost as they are in the same location. "

    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Now that we have a fully functioning model, we will start with our sensitivity analysis. The first one we will look at is what happens if our cars get damaged. The reason we chose this topic is because there have been many flash flood warnings in San Diego in 2017. It is therefore important for management to take into account the number of car we will lose. EV’s may be significantly damaged rendered completely unusable after flooding occurs. We will therefore look at what happens if we cnage the number of cars available. To do so we will assume 10% of the vehicles of the city will be damaged and therefore not usable. We will also attempt to find the lowest number of cars needed in order to satisfy the demand."

Considering the costs of making our service available in a zip code such as maintenance and repositioning, we wondered whether removing the stations in zip codes that have the least trips or demand would improve our profitability. Our main costs come from the repositioning of vehicles. Usually these come from unpopular zips to popular zips. If we restric Car2go to only popular zip codes then maybe we will be able to increase profits.\n"
